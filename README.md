# FINAL-DEGREE-PROJECT
This repository contains the code and data for my final degree project, which investigates the evolutionary relationships between unicellular and multicellular species. The study focuses on transcription factors and basal gene families that are crucial for understanding the emergence of multicellularity, through a comparative genomics approach.
